# ML-Hardware-guide
This ML/Hardware doc is handy if you're trying to figure out how to implement machine learning algorithms on hardware. It goes over the details of convolution layers and other core ML concepts that you need to know when you're writing RTL code.
One of the best parts is, it's got helpful links and explanations on converting floating-point numbers to fixed-point. That's crucial when you're working with hardware since fixed-point math tends to be more efficient.
This document is available in Persian. I will write an English version of it in the future.
